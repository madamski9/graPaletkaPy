# Paddle Ball Bounce

### Game Description

This is a computer game built in Python using the Pygame library. The player controls a paddle using the arrow keys to bounce a ball, preventing it from reaching the bottom of the screen. The game becomes progressively more challenging with each level, introducing screen shaking effects and multiple balls as difficulty increases. There are 6 levels in total, each adding new layers of intensity and requiring quick reflexes.

### Game Mechanics

- **Paddle Control**: The player uses the **left** and **right arrow keys** to move the paddle.
- **Objective**: Bounce the ball to prevent it from touching the bottom edge of the screen.
- **Difficulty Levels**: The game has 6 levels, each with additional challenges:
  - With each level, the ballâ€™s speed increases.
  - Screen shaking intensity rises on each level, making paddle control trickier.
  - As the player progresses, multiple balls appear, increasing the challenge of keeping all balls in play.

### Key Features

1. **Smooth Arrow Key Control**: Paddle movement is responsive to the left and right arrow keys, allowing precise control for effective ball bouncing.
2. **Screen Shaking Effect**: The screen begins to shake, with intensity increasing at each new level.
3. **Ball Duplication**: Every few levels, additional balls appear, requiring the player to keep track of multiple objects simultaneously.
4. **Progressive Difficulty**: Each level ramps up the ball speed and shake effect, requiring faster reactions and adaptability.

### Technology & Requirements

- **Language**: Python
- **Library**: Pygame
- **Platform**: Designed for desktop computers

### How to Play

1. Use the **left** and **right arrow keys** to control the paddle.
2. Bounce the ball and prevent it from hitting the bottom of the screen.
3. Adapt to the increasing difficulty on each level with faster balls, shaking screen effects, and multiple balls.
